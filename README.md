# uptime monitoring

## description
Start monitoring a website.
When the website goes down, I'll let you know by sms

### notes
* the sms feature is disabled just for testing reasons.
You can create your twilio (https://www.twilio.com/en-us) account if you want
and test the sms feature
* I know the authentication process is shitty. I just need a way to mantein the session
